# Overview

This project is a web-based GIS application designed to further my learning as a software engineer. The application displays a map using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and allows users to interact with isochrone overlays generated by clicking on the map. The overlays are enhanced by user controls to vary the distance, type of travel, and overlay style, providing a rich, interactive experience with geographical data.

The purpose of this software is to gain hands-on experience with GIS technologies and to understand how to integrate and display geographical data in a web application.

## Deployment

- To run locally, use the following commands:
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

## Development Environment

The development environment for this project includes:

- Visual Studio Code as the IDE
- ArcGIS API for JavaScript for map rendering and GIS functionalities
- Node.js with Express for backend server management
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development

## Features and Updates

- **Customizable Isochrone Overlays:**
  - Users can input custom increments for overlays (e.g., 15, 30, or 45 minutes/miles).
  - Overlays are dynamically generated based on the user's input.
- **Travel Direction and Mode:**
  - The application supports user-defined travel direction (e.g., "from location" or "to location") and travel modes (e.g., driving or walking).
- **Overlay Styles:**
  - Users can select the style of overlays (e.g., solid, diagonal lines, or crosshatch) from a dropdown menu.
- **Secure API Key Management:**
  - The ArcGIS API key is securely managed using environment variables.

## Future Work

- Optimize the user interface for a more engaging user experience.
- Integrate additional data sources for a more comprehensive data display.
- Add authentication and user accounts for saving custom overlays.

_Way Later_

- Develop a feature to save and share custom isochrone maps.
- Implement real-time traffic data integration for more accurate travel time calculations.
