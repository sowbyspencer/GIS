# Overview

This project is a web-based GIS application designed to further my learning as a software engineer. The application displays a map using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and allows users to view markers representing different locations. The map initially centers on the user's current location, and markers can be added to represent points of interest.

The purpose of this software is to gain hands-on experience with GIS technologies and to understand how to integrate and display geographical data in a web application.
