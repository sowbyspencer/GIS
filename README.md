# Overview

This project is a web-based GIS application designed to further my learning as a software engineer. The application displays a map using the ArcGIS API for JavaScript and also allows users to view markers representing locations, such as restaurants, parks, and schools, fetched dynamically using the Google Places API. Additionally, the application features interactive isochrone overlays that users can generate by clicking on the map, enhancing the geographical data interaction within the web application.

The purpose of this software is to gain hands-on experience with GIS technologies and to understand how to integrate and display geographical data in a web application.
